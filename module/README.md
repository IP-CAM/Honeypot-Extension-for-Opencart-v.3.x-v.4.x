### What is a honeypot?
*Honeypot* is an anti-spam technique that baits bots into filling out hidden form fields and then rejects their submissions. Human users cannot see these fields, so they leave them empty. However, bots parse the HTML code and attempt to complete every available field. This behavior allows us to identify and block automated bot submissions.

Unlike traditional CAPTCHAs, which disrupt the user experience (UX) by creating friction and slowing down the customer journey, honeypot protection is invisible to users and requires no action from them.

## Features
* Easy to install and configure, just like any other captcha.
* In addition to standard pages, this also protects the gift certificate and forgotten password pages.
* Invisible to customers.
